# SAFE
SAFE, or Secure Architectural Framework Enhancements employs a small change in computational architecture 
to effect a significant change in the architecture’s security model. Its primary goal is to significantly 
change the operational security mechanism for computing in general (sensor-controllers to supercomputers), 
while preserving application software, minimizing operational cost, and maximizing performance. SAFE offers 
compatibility with legacy application binaries, that it is faster, lower power, and simpler than the legacy 
architecture it replaces; and that most importantly is secureable.

SAFE is a hardware-based containerization technology that replaces the
lowest levels of fungible Operating System (OS) software with hardware. SAFE’s primary security mechanism 
is the universal application of a hardware managed, hierarchically cached, Address Space (AS) model that 
relies on indices (tags) to select one Address Space Tag (AST) from a plethora of concurrently accessible ASTs.
